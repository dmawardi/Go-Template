            <h2>Authorization Section</h2>
            <p>This crucial area of the panel is divided into three main portions: Permissions, Roles, and Inheritance.</p>

            <div class="permissions">
                <h3>Permissions</h3>
                <p>
                    Manage creation and updates of resources, typically represented as URLs, and their associated permissions including create, read, update, and delete, grouped by role. Utilize single (*) and double (**) wildcards for sub-URL permissions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="roles">
                <h3>Roles</h3>
                <p>
                    Create roles within the application and assign specific sets of permissions to these roles for structured and organized access management.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="inheritance">
                <h3>Inheritance</h3>
                <p>
                    Set up hierarchical structures within roles to allow certain roles to inherit permissions from others, simplifying complex permission structures.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="user-schema">
            <h2>User Schema</h2>
            <p>
                Link directly to the permissions with role assignments for individual users. Manage user access levels and roles efficiently.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="other-schemas">
            <h2>Other Schemas</h2>
            <p>
                Below the User Schema, find all other schemas associated with the application, including data models, settings, and other configurations.
            </p>
